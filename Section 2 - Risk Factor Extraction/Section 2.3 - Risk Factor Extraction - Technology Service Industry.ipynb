    "In section 1, we have downloaded the fincancial reports from 2019Q1 to 2023Q3. In this section, we are going to extract the risk factor text from each of these files. According to the requirement of the 10-K form given by SEC (https://www.sec.gov/files/form10-k.pdf), there is an section named \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" included in the form  which shows the potential risks faced by the company. Therefore, it is important for us to filter and cleanse the text from this part so that we can use it for further analysis."
